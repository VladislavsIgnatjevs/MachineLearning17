# MachineLearning17

This is an exercise written for a Machine Learning assignment at university
As a starting point, three image descriptors (digit one, digit five, digit eight) are taken from MNIST handwritten digit database.
The exercise shows the differences, implications, performances of between different classification techniques.
Apart from that it shows the differences, implications of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) when used for dimensionality reduction of the data set.

Exercise uses PCA/LDA for dimensionality reduction (into 2 dim), k-means clustering (3 clusters) to partiate date for visibility on the scatter plot.

Finally, it uses SVM with a RBF kernel, SVM
with a linear kernel, and a neural network classifier with one hidden layer to classify the
dataset.

Things to do:
. add 5-fold cross validation setting.

Please note that this was created for the university assignment, therefore this can contain bugs/mistakes. If you see ways to improve the code, let me know by comment or email :)
